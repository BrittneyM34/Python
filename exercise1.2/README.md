# Python

# Second Task

## Task Goals:

- Create a data structure for Recipe app
- Explain variables and data types in Python
- Summarize the use of objects in Python

## Reasons For Data Choice

I used a dictionary to be able to store more types of data. This allows more flexibilty in the information that I can store in each one. Dictionaries are able to store the cooking time as integers, the name as a string, and the ingredients in a list. I used a list for the outer structure because I am able to store many recipes that I am able to modify if needed.
