# Exercise 1.7

## Learning Goals:
- Interact wiht a database using an object-relational mapper
- Build your final command-line Recipe Application

## Reflection Questions

1. What is an Object Relational Mapper and what are the advantages of using one?

2. By this point you've finished creating your Recipe app. How did it go? What's something in the app that you did well with? If you were to start over, what's somehting about your app that you would change or improve?

3. Imagine you're at a job interview. You're asked what experience you have creating an app using Python. Taking your work for this Achievement as an example, draft how you would respond to this question.

4. You'e finished Achievement 1! Before moving on to Achievement 2, take a moment to reflect on your learning in the course so far:
   - What went well during this Achievement?
   - What's something you're proud of?
   - What was the most challenging aspect of this Achievement?
   - Did this Achievement meet your expectations? Did it give you the confidence to start working with your new Python skills?
   - What's something you want to keep in mind to help you do your best in Achievement 2?
   
## Answers
1. An Object Relational mapper bridges the gap between object oriented programming lanugages and relational databases. It translates the language of objects in a programming lanugae into SQL queries for the database. An advantage is increased developer productivity. The significantly reduce the need to write out complex SQL queries which saves time and effort for the developer. Also it improves code maintainability by making the code more readable and maintanable while it focuses on manipulating objects instead of SQL details.

2. I think my Recipe app went pretty well. I think I did well writing out the user interface with descriptive and easy to read messages and directions. If I were to start over I would make sure to comment more information about what the blocks of code do.

3. In my most recent project I developed a Recipe app using Python that used SQLAlchemy for the database management. This allowed me to integrate Python's programmming abilities with a relational databse. I also used an object relational mapper for more efficient data handling. This project has improved my skills in Python, especially for error handling, creating interactive applications and managing data.

4. One this that went well is that it really improved my understanding of concepts in Python. I am proud of the fact I was able to relatively easily troubleshoot any issues that I was having while trying to run my code to fix anything that wasn't working properly. The most challenging aspect for me was making sure my indents were correct. I had a lot of issues with the last assignment and most of them were due to indenting issues. With this assignment I made sure to pay closer attention to the indents and it helped me avoid a lot of problems. This achievement did give me more confidence to start working with Python, I do think I need to keep practicing to get where I need to be, but I do plan on doing that. For achievement 2 I will do better at anticipating issues that may arise in my code and I have a way better knowledge of what to look for than I did before starting this achievement
