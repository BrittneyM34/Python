# Exercise 2.1

## Learning Goals:

- Explain MVT architecture and compare it with MVC
- Summarize Django's benefits and drawbacks
- Install and get started with Django

## Reflection Questions: 

1. Suppose you're a web developer in a company and need to decide if you'll use vanilla (plain) Python for a project, or a framework like Django instead. What are the advantages and drawbacks of each?

2. In your own words, what is the most significant advantage of Model View Template (MVT) architecture over Model View Controller (MVC) architecture?

3. Now that youâ€™ve had an introduction to the Django framework, write down three goals you have for yourself and your learning process during this achievement. You can reflect on the following questions if it helps:
What do you want to learn about Django? 
What do you want to get out of this Achievement? 
Where or what do you see yourself working on after you complete this Achievement?

## Answers:

1. With vanilla Python you have complete contol over every aspect of the application. It is also more lightweight which makes it more beneficial for small and simple projects. One of the drawbacks is that you have to build everything from scratch which can take a lot longer than if you were to use a framework. Also implementing security measures requires a lot more careful implementation and it is a lot more high maintenence to manage a large application without a framework and can make it a lot more prone to errors. With Django you can have rapid development with built in features for authentication and templates. This makes the development process a lot faster than building it from scratch. It also includes security features to protect against common vulnerabilities that applications can face. As well as a large community for support. One of the drawbacks is that Django has more of a learning curve compared to vanilla Python and can be overkill for smaller and simpler projects. Another downside is with Django you have less flexibility to customize the application.

2. In MVC the controller usually handles both of the user interactions and preparing the data for the view. This can cause the controllers to become difficult to maintain as the application grows and becomes more complex. With MCT the view's responsibility is only the presentation while the controller handles user interactions and data retrieval. The fact that these are seaparated makes the codebase more organized and easier to understand. MVT provides a better separation of each section and makes web applications more efficient and maintainable.

3. By the end of this achievement I hope to be a lot more confident in my abilities to work with the features of Django. I also want to understand the concepts in backend development better, I understand how to use them but I guess I am just looking at understanding what exactly goes on behind the scenes better. Once I am done with this achievement I will begin working on making a website for my friend's grandparents' company.
