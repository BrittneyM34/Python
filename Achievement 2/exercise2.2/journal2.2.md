# Exercise 2.2

## Learning Goals:

- Describe the basic structure of a Django project
- Summarize the difference between projects and apps
- Create a Django project and run it locally
- Create a superuser for a Django web application

## Reflection Questions: 

1. Suppose you're in an interview. The interviewer gives you their company's website as an example, asking you to convert the webiste and its different parts into Django terms. How would you proceed? For this question, you can think about your dream company and look at their website for reference.

2. In your own words, describe the steps you would take to deploy a basic Django application locally on your system.

3. Do some research about the Django admin site and write down how you'd use it during your web application development

## Answers:
1. In the Facebook website, the website as a whole is the project. In the project there are multiple different apps that let you complete different tasks. For example the login authenticates your information and allows you to login. The profile app lets you view your information on your profile.

2. First I would create a virtual envrionment and install Django in that environment, then I would create a new project using Django built-in commands. This is going to create the general file structure for my application. Next, I would run mitigations to create the database for my application and then I would run the server. Then, I would create a super user the create the admin page. I would add the apps to my project that would perform specific functions in the application. Then I would run the server in the local host.

3. The admin panel is an interface where users are able to create, read, update, and delete directly on the moedel. The user is able to manage contents of the site which saves a lot of time in the development process.
