# Exercise 1.5

## Learning Goals:
- Apply object-oriented programming concepts to your Recipe app

## Reflection Questions

1. In your own words, what is object-oriented programming? What are the benefits of OOP?

2. What are objects and classes in Python? Come up with a real-world example to illustrate how objects and classes work.

3. In your own words, write brief explanations of the following OOP concepts; 100 to 200 words per method is fine.
   
## Answers
1. Object oriented programming is a way of thinking for organizing code around objects. By using objects and classes it helps organize code to be easier to read as well as improving the reusability of the code. Instead of typing the same blocks of code over and over, you can use classes to call a block of code.

2. Objects represent concepts with properties and behaviors. They have attributes and methods. Classes define the structure and behavior of the objects. They are like blueprints. A real life example is a car. The attributes of a car are like the color, model, and year the car was made. The methods are the things that the car does, for example, brake and accelerate. The class of the car is the blueprint or the frame of the car. The frame defines the structure and shape of the car.

3. Polymorphism uses generic code that works with various object types. This allows you to reuse code to do similar but different things. Inheritance is where child classes inherit properites from their parent classes. This way the same code does not get written over and over and can just be inherited from a parent class. Abstraction uses simplified methods for users to interact with objects. The user doesn't know the internal things that make the object function but they are able to use the method. This improves the readability and maintainabilty of the code. Encapsulation protects the code from external modifications. The user is able to access the details but the internal workings stay hidden and are not able to be changed. This helps with data security and prevents accidental changes.
