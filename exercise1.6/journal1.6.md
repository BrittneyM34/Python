# Exercise 1.6

## Learning Goals:
- Create a MySQL database for your Recipe app

## Reflection Questions

1. What are databases and what are the advantages of using them?

2. List 3 data types that can be used in MySQL and describe them briefly

3. In what situations would SQLite be a better choice than MySQL?

4. Think back to what you learned in the Immersion course. What do you think about the differences between JavaScript and Python as programming languages?

5. Now that youâ€™re nearly at the end of Achievement 1, consider what you know about Python so far. What would you say are the limitations of Python as a programming language?
   
## Answers
1. Databases are organized structures of data that are used to efficiently store, manage, and retrieve information. They store data in a way that is easy to read and access as the data is organized and categorized. This also makes data retrieval faster and more efficient.

2. INT: stores whole numbers
   VARCHAR: stores text strings with lengths with a specific range of characters. It is effecient for storing text data that may vary in size.
   DATE: store calendar dates in the format YYY-MM-DD

3. SQLite is designed for single use applications where a separate database server isn't convenient. It is good for initial development and prototypess, as it is easy to set up without having to manage a separate server. MySQL offers more features and scalability for larger scale applications. It is a better option if you are needing a more complex database logic.

4. Since I have had more experience working with JavaScript more, I prefer working with JavaScript over Python. I feel that I am able to problem solve a bit better with JavaScript over Python. That said, I do feel like the syntax for Python is a bit easier for me to understand.

5. I have not currently come across any limitations on my own, but after some research I have learned that sometimes Python can have some performance issues. The code is executed line by line which can cause the script to run a bit slower than other compiled languages.
